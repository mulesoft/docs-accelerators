= SAP S/4HANA Setup Guide

The following describes how to configure and test an S/4HANA Cloud SOAP outbound service (Product replication: `productmdmbulkreplicaterequest`) and the S/4HANA Cloud SOAP Connector as a Mule application deployed on Cloudhub.

== Configurations in S/4HANA

To make the necessary configurations in S/4HANA:

. Create a *Communication System* in the corresponding Fiori app. This communication system represents the external system that will consume the S/4HANA Cloud SOAP service. In this example, it's named "COM_0009_SOAP_OUT": +

 +
. For the 'Business System' name, use the same name of the System ID.
. In the 'Host Name' field, enter the hostname of the Mule application deployed on Cloudhub (if you don't have it yet, you can enter a mock URL and then modify it later): +

 +
. Create a user that will be used to connect to the Cloud Hub app for sending product information in the outbound scenario (this is necessary even though the Mule application does not validate the user; we used any user for outbound): +
 +

 +
. Use the *Communication Arrangement* Fiori app to create a new Communication Arrangement: +

 +
. Create a new *Communication Arrangement*, select the communication scenario "SAP_COM_0009", and then define a specific name for the arrangement, "SAP_COM_0009_SOAP".
. In the *Communication System* field, select the Communication System created in the previous step: +

 +
. For outbound communication, select the previously-created user and configure the *Product Master - Replicate from SAP S/4HANA Cloud to Client* and include the following settings. Make sure to note the Path (`/sap/bc/srt/scs/sap/productmdmbulkreplicaterequest`) because we will use this path to configure the Mule application SOAP endpoint:
 ** Set the Service status to *Active*
 ** Replication Model (any name)
 ** Replication model = I (Initial)
 ** The Output Mode = D (Direct). +

. Save it. All configurations at S/4HANA Cloud side are finished and you will be able to download the WSDL that contains the metadata to import into the S/4HANA Cloud SOAP Connector into the Mule application.

== Configurations in the Mule Application

The following example describes how to create a Mule application using the Outbound Message Listener operation of MuleSoft's SAP S/4HANA SOAP Connector:

. Create a Mule project and add the appropriate connector from Exchange to the Mule Palette: +

. Add the corresponding WSDL path to the WSDL you downloaded from S/4HANA Cloud and create the HTTP listener configuration: +

_*Note*: we are using no authentication on the Mule Application, so we used the Insecure option for the Trust Store Configuration. In the Keystore configuration, we used a test Keystore, which is mandatory for HTTPS communication:_ +

. On the Responses tab, use the status Code "202" and the Reason-Phrase "Accepted" because we want to send the same status that S/4HANA Cloud will send if the service invocation results OK. No payload will be returned as a response--just the Status code and Reason-phrase: +

. Deploy the application to Cloudhub. You're now ready to test the scenario.

== Testing the scenario

. Create the following. You only need to create a material in the corresponding Fiori app of S/4HANA Cloud: +
