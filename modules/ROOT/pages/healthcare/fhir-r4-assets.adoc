= FHIR R4 assets

The following are a collection of assets to support MuleSoft customers who are developing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) APIs using MuleSoft. Visit the official HL7 website for more information.

* FHIR RAML auto-generator — Utility to generate RAML specification(s) for FHIR resources directly from the JSON schema provided by HL7.
* FHIR R4 US Core Profile Assets
* FHIR R4 Resources List
* FHIR Error API Policy — Captures error responses and formats them in an FHIR OperationOutcome-compliant format, since Anypoint Platform's out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies do not provide error messages in an FHIR-compliant format. This policy can also be used with other OOTB API policies provided in Anypoint Platform, such as OAuth or JWT.
