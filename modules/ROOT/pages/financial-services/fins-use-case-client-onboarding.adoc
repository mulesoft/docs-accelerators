Solution overview
The goal of this solution is to add support for onboarding new WAM clients onto Salesforce FSC via a marketing campaign.

The solution supports the following functionality:

Ability to create leads in Salesforce FSC when a potential client responds to a marketing campaign
Automatic Know Your Client (KYC) checks when leads become opportunities
Automatic document generation when opportunities pass KYC
Update of opportunities based on the results of KYC checks
Support for synchronizing household accounts between Salesforce FSC instances
High-level architecture
The following diagram represents the portion of the solution that pertains to the client onboarding for wealth management use case.

Technical considerations and constraints
The following lists the technical considerations and constraints for this solution design:

Salesforce FSC Wealth will be the system of record for Wealth & Asset Management
The system will not convert leads into opportunities: this must be done by the Financial Advisor
The KYC check will be simulated in this release; it can be replaced with a system API that runs the KYC check with a suitable backend
Processing views
This section provides detailed processing sequences for lead, opportunity, and document notification handling.

Lead creation
A potential client responds to a marketing campaign by submitting a form. The system takes the information and creates a new Lead in FSC Wealth for review by a financial advisor. Please follow instructions outlined in the Marketing Cloud setup guide for setting up the email campaign.

The creation of a lead begins with a request from Marketing Cloud to the Salesforce Wealth Experience API.

Activity diagram for lead creation
Opportunity processing
A Lead is reviewed and converted to an Opportunity in FSC by the financial advisor if they determine that the lead is a good candidate for a potential client.

The opportunity creation triggers a KYC check. If the check passes, onboarding documents are generated and sent out for signature.

The processing of a new opportunity begins with an update event posted to Anypoint MQ by the Salesforce Topic Listener.

Activity diagram for opportunity processing
Document notification
DocuSign sends a notification that the client has signed the forms, and the opportunity is marked as closed/won in FSC Wealth.

This activity begins with DocuSign invoking the DocuSign Experience API via a configured webhook to notify that the documents are signed and the onboarding process can be completed.

Activity diagram for document notification
Household synchronization
The synchronization of Household accounts (an Account object with a record type of Household) begins with an update event being received by the Salesforce Topic Listener from one of the Salesforce FSC orgs. While the diagram below shows the update originating from Wealth, the process is the same for Banking and Insurance as well.

Note: This process is depicted as using "upserts" for persisting objects in FSC solely for the purpose of keeping the diagram readable. In actual fact, the system APIs have separate endpoints for the creation and update of objects to allow for a wider range of use cases. The logic to look up an object to determine whether a create or update call is required is part of the Customers Process API - it is just not shown here for the sake of clarity.
