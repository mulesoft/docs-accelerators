= Payments Modernization Demo Setup Guide

== Overview

* A Docker runtime will be required to deploy containers needed by the solution.
* A generic core banking system will be used as the primary system of record.
* Moov.io containers will be used to simulate the processing of ACH and Fedwire messages.
* A third-party Java library will be used to simulate the processing of SWIFT messages.
* A custom process will be used to simulate incoming payment confirmations.
* A xref:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/fins-payments-frontend-webui-src/[Payments Front-end Web UI] has been built to demonstrate the functionality implemented by this use case.
* MultiChain Wallet Node is used to support processing of BlockChain Transactions.

== Setup

This guide sets up a demo environment with the supported backend services used by the provided API implementations. When these APIs are adopted by a MuleSoft customer, it is expected that the customer will replace these example backend services with their preferred services.

The following containerized services are deployed on docker. For demo purposes, it is recommended to deploy all containers on a single Docker node.

* moov.io ACH service
* moov.io Fedwire service
* Payments Front-end Web UI
* Blockchain based on MultiChain

The Payments Front-end Web UI can also be run locally, outside of a container, by following the instructions provided in its README file.

=== Payments Front-End Web UI Recommended Setup:

. Install Docker and its dependencies on the server of your choice.
. Configure the Payments Front-end Web UI by modifying the following properties in the .env file:
.. `REACT_APP_PAYMENTS_WEBUI_EXP_API_ENDPOINT` should point to an instance of the Payments Web UI Experience API
.. `REACT_APP_PAYMENTS_WEBUI_EXP_API_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT` should point to an instance of the Payments Web UI Experience API
. Build the docker image by running its docker-build.sh script.
. Start the docker container by running the docker-run.sh script on the machine running the Docker server, or use a Docker administration UI to manage the containers.
. Update `https.cors.allow-url` property in the Payments Web UI Experience API with the Payments Front-end Web UI endpoint to allow CORS.

=== Moov.io Recommended Setup:

The moov.io images are provided pre-built as-is. They can be started on the Docker server by using the included docker-run.sh scripts.

=== MultiChain Setup:

To run the MultiChain node as a docker container, perform the following steps:

. Use the Dockerfile from the scripts folder in the Blockchain System API to build the MultiChain image.
. Run the `docker-run.sh` script to deploy the container and setup network ports. Run `docker-exec.sh` to create MultiChain and configure the json-rpc service to interact with the MultiChain container.
