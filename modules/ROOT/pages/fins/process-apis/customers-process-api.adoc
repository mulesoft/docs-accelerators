== Summary

The FINS Customers Process API is used to orchestrate the Customer, Individual, Organization, and Household creation and update to/from the Salesforce FSC Banking, Salesforce FSC Insurance, Salesforce FSC Wealth, Salesforce Marketing, LOS, and Core Banking systems. 

This API uses the Accelerator Global Party Process API to maintain a global representation of a customer, which can provide a 360 degree view of the customer by storing identifiers representing the customer in various systems. A unique global ID is generated for each customer to uniquely identify the profiles being synchronized across all target systems. 

The Cloud Information Model (CIM) is leveraged to interact with each of the System APIs that have been developed for Customer sync use cases.

== Business Process

The following sequence diagram describes the process of synchronizing updates made to customers in Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to downstream systems:

== Using this Asset

The implementation template for this API can be imported directly into Anypoint Studio from Exchange. Ensure the required prerequisites are available and the mandatory property overrides are in place before attempting to run or deploy the application.

=== Anypoint Exchange Assets

Refer to the following links to download the assets for this API:

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/fins-customers-prc-api-spec/[API Specification^]

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/fins-customers-prc-api/[Implementation Template^]

=== Prerequisite Setup

The implementation template has the following dependencies:

* Anypoint MQ Destinations
* Accelerator Global Party Process API
* FINS Salesforce Customers System API (supports multiple deployments for separate FSC instances)
* FINS Salesforce Marketing System API
* FINS Core Banking Customers System API
* FINS Loan Origination System API

Please review the use cases described on the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/8f5e182d-2f4a-4ac0-a319-28f660de099c/mulesoft-accelerator-for-financial-services/[MuleSoft Accelerator for Financial Services^] solution pages for more information about dependencies on other APIs and services.

==== Anypoint MQ Destinations

In addition to the Anypoint MQ client application credentials, the following destinations must be created and made accessible to this API:

* fins-partyrole-update-queue
* fins-partyrole-update-dl-queue
* fins-party-update-queue
* fins-party-update-dl-queue

The xref:./custom-components/fins-common-resources.adoc[FINS Common Resources] asset contains a Postman collection, which can be used to create the destinations and client application required for use by accelerator applications.
