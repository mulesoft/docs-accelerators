=== Functional Considerations

* Customer, product and order data needs to be in csv or xlsx format.
* Customer and product data needs be loaded into Manufacturing Cloud before loading order data so that orders can be attached existing customers and products.

=== Technical Considerations

This section lists the technical considerations and constraints on the solution design.

* The csv and xlsx files need to be in the format specified <<file-formats,below>>
* MDM implementation is required in order to reference customer and product data in orders

=== Systems Involved

* Salesforce Manufacturing Cloud
* SFTP Server
* PIM Database
* Anypoint MQ
* Global Data Management

=== Processing Logic

* SFTP CIM handler reads the files from sftp location and converts the records to respective link:[CIM] structures and publishes the records to the customers, products and orders exchanges for the related objects.
* The corresponding process APIs process the messages in CIM format and insert the data into Manufacturing Cloud via the corresponding system APIs.

== SFTP Setup

In your SFTP server create inbox, archive and error folders for customers, products and orders.

== File Configuration

* The sftp integrations can only read comma separated text file with *.csv extension or Microsoft Excel file with *.xlsx extension
* For excel files, make sure all the data is in one tab and the tab names must be following: CustomerInfo, OrderInfo and ProductInfo respectively
