= MuleSoft Accelerators Overview

Accelerators are a collection of technical assets (predominantly API specifications and implementation templates), reference architectures, and documentation that can be used to accelerate the implementation of multiple use cases supporting a larger business or industry problem.

Accelerators are designed as modular building blocks: customers can change the patterns, mappings, and endpoints to suit their needs. They represent best practices we recommend to customers in accomplishing these use cases. Customers will save hours of discovery, design, development, and testing each time they use an accelerator asset.

To access any of the asset links described within the following Accelerators, you must log in to the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/home/[Anypoint Platform^].
